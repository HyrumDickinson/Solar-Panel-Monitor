### 6-11-2021
- [X] **Hyrum Dickinson** - `python-2-version` - fixed syntax errors and made slight changes to imports for the GUI code. It now runs very responsively in a correctly set up python environment (see python-2-version README). 
- [X] **Hyrum Dickinson** - `python-3-version` - made parallel changes as to python-2-version. However, when ran on python 3 instead of 2, the GUI continues to run extremely slow.
